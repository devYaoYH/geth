# The bridge between "an agent wants a task run" and "no agent may touch
# docker": agents (the assistant, mostly) file a coordination issue titled
# `run: <brief>` with the `task-request` label; THIS host-side script — cron,
# not an agent — polls those requests, validates them against the tracked
# briefs in tasks/, and executes scripts/run-task.sh. The agent proposes,
# deterministic code executes, and the issue thread records the outcome.
#
#   ./scripts/task-dispatcher.sh            # one pass (cron provides the loop)
#   ./scripts/task-dispatcher.sh --dry-run  # validate + report, run nothing
#   */10 7-23 * * *  cd /path/to/node && ./scripts/task-dispatcher.sh >> /var/log/node-dispatch.log 2>&1
#
# What keeps this safe to automate:
#   - Only briefs that EXIST in tasks/ on the merged checkout can run — an
#     agent cannot author a new prompt into execution; new briefs arrive via
#     agent-dev PR + operator merge, like any capability change.
#   - Only briefs whose frontmatter says `dispatch: auto` are eligible; the
#     flag itself ships through review.
#   - The issue body is NEVER passed to the tenant — no parameter smuggling;
#     the brief is the whole prompt, budgets included.
#   - Per-brief cooldown (1h) bounds what a request-spamming (or injected)
#     agent can burn: each brief's own budget, at most hourly.

# --- assigned-issue mode ----------------------------------------------------
# Operator assigns a coordination issue to agent-dev (in the web UI, with a
# passkey) => this pass launches an ephemeral tenant to work it. The trigger
# (an Actions "doorbell" workflow, or just this cron pass) is only a HINT:
# every fact below is re-derived from the Forgejo API and the merged checkout,
# so a forged nudge or a compromised runner cannot cause an unauthorized run.
#
# The gate, in order — each is independently sufficient to refuse:
#   1. agent-dev is actually an assignee (not just a stale mention).
#   2. NOT already claimed: no `in-progress` label (the cross-instance lock).
#   3. The assignment was performed BY THE OPERATOR — read from the issue
#      timeline's assign-event actor. Assistant/agent tokens hold write on
#      coordination and CAN self-assign (verified), so "assigned" alone is not
#      authorization; "assigned by the operator" is. This is the anti-
#      escalation core.
#   4. The issue number ONLY is handed to the tenant; the body never is. The
#      agent fetches the body itself, as data, under its own scoped token.

# in-progress label id (the durable claim). Must pre-exist — creating it at
# runtime is how coordination's other labels got triplicated. Look up, don't create.
