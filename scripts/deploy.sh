# Why it pulls FORGEJO, not origin: agent PRs merge on the Forgejo node-config
# repo (the tree the jail clones). GitHub `origin` is the public template and

#    local tracking stay consistent (sync-node-config pushes the other way).
git push origin main || echo "deploy: WARN could not push origin (continuing; node is already at merged main)"

# 3. Refresh derived secrets (e.g. RADICALE_WEB_AUTH) before compose reads .env.
./scripts/derive-secrets.sh

# 3b. Mint per-app credentials the merged tree now expects: scaffold any missing
#     secrets/<app>.env (a missing env_file aborts the WHOLE compose up before
#     any container starts), auto-generate blank `# mint:` secrets, and flag any
#     operator-owed `# require:` ones. Idempotent — only ever fills blanks.
./scripts/mint-secrets.sh

# 3c. Ensure difficulty:* labels exist in the coordination repo (idempotent).
#     These are the per-issue model-routing knobs for issue-work dispatch.
#     Safe to re-run: Forgejo deduplicates label creation by name.
./scripts/ensure-tier-labels.sh || echo "deploy: WARN ensure-tier-labels.sh failed (non-fatal; labels may need manual creation)"

# 4. Build any mirrored images that are missing (idempotent: existing images
#    are skipped). This happens before compose up so the image reference in
#    the compose fragment resolves. Only touches apps with a [build] section
#    in their manifest.
./scripts/build-mirrored.sh

# 5. Apply: recreate any service whose spec changed (env/image/etc).
#    Two passes, because "which profiles are enabled" is the OPERATOR's call,
#    not this script's: first the core plane (default profile), then every
#    profile-gated service that is CURRENTLY RUNNING — naming a service
#    explicitly auto-enables its profile, and `ps --services` lists running
#    project containers regardless of profile flags. Deploy recreates what
#    runs; it never starts a profile the operator hasn't enabled. (The old
#    `--profile apps` here silently skipped feeds/chat/authshim services —
#    miniflux kept stale env across deploys.)

# 6. Bind-mounted CONTENT changes don't recreate containers — compose only
#    diffs the service spec. Caddy gets a validated reload (routes are its
#    config); any app whose apps/<name>/ files changed beyond compose.yaml/
#    route.caddy (e.g. radicale's `config` file, read once at startup) gets a
#    restart so the process actually re-reads what the merge changed.
