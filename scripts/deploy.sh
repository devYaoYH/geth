#     operator-owed `# require:` ones. Idempotent — only ever fills blanks.

# 4. Build any mirrored images that are missing (idempotent: existing images

#    the compose fragment resolves. Only touches apps with a [build] section

# 4b. Rebuild locally-built images whose build inputs changed in this merge.
#     'docker compose up -d' (step 5) does NOT rebuild an existing image, so a

#     running container — exactly what stranded the launcher compose-plugin fix
#     (image kept the pre-fix build; `docker compose` was absent, so every
#     launch 500'd). Diff-driven so deploys stay fast: only apps whose baked-in
#     files changed get rebuilt; step 5 then recreates them (compose recreates
#     on image-id change, so no --build needed there). CHANGED is computed once

# (recreate with no new image = no change; exactly what stranded snake's fixes).
# `--profiles` lists every profile defined anywhere; feeding them all back via

# starts nothing, so the operator still owns which profiles actually run (step 5
