# sovereign-node

A personal sovereign cloud: self-hosted identity, everyday services, and tenant
agents,
running on hardware you own, behind a front door you control.

This is the **Tier 3 MVP** — the compute-box profile for people who already have a
domain and are comfortable with Docker. See `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md` for why this exists,
`docs/DESIGN.md` for how it fits together, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` for where it goes.

## What is here now

| Plane | Services | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Front door | Caddy, Pocket ID | TLS, trusted-network rings, and passkey-backed OIDC |
| Operator workspace | Homepage, Forgejo, LiteLLM | Home dashboard, change ledger, model budgets and request audit |
| Everyday apps | Radicale, Memos, Miniflux, Snake | Calendar/contacts, notes, feeds, and a small break |
| Assistant & agents | Open WebUI, `assistant`, `agent` | Front-door conversation plus a constrained development tenant |
| Controlled integrations | search-broker, gog-bridge | Audited Exa search and read-only Google bridge access |
| Node internals | Registry, private Postgres services, docker-proxy | Discovery, isolated state, and read-only dashboard health |

Ephemeral agent tenants (one container, one task, one budgeted key) run via
`scripts/run-task.sh` from briefs in `tasks/` — see docs/AGENT.md. Every tenant
gets its own scoped credentials, budget, workspace, and expiry.

## Everyday entry points

After setup, `https://home.<domain>` is the daily landing page: Home, Workshop,
Operations, and Security all share the assistant prompt bar. The most useful
doors are `chat.<domain>` for full conversations, `git.<domain>` for proposals
and mirrors, and `search.<domain>` for the Ring 0 agent-search audit. See
`docs/SEARCH.md` for the current search boundary and retention model.

## Quickstart

0. Or let the installer do 1–3 and validate the result (idempotent —
   also safe to re-run on an existing node as a config check):

       ./scripts/install.sh

1. Copy env and fill it in:

       cp .env.example .env
       # generate strong values:  openssl rand -hex 32

2. Point DNS at this box (or your front-door anchor):
   `home.yourdomain`, `chat.yourdomain`, `git.yourdomain`, `llm.yourdomain`,
   `cal.yourdomain`, `notes.yourdomain`, `feeds.yourdomain`, and
   `auth.yourdomain` → your public IP / VPS.
   No public exposure wanted? Leave DNS unset and use the `lan` Caddyfile variant.

3. Review `manifest/node.example.yaml` and copy it to `manifest/node.yaml`.
   The manifest records *where each concern lives*. The MVP reads it as
   documentation; the installer-agent (M1) will read it as instructions.

4. Bring it up:

       docker compose up -d
       docker compose --profile apps up -d     # calendar, notes, Snake, search
       docker compose --profile chat up -d     # Open WebUI
       docker compose --profile feeds up -d    # Miniflux

   Optional profiles are deliberately explicit: `bridge` enables the Google
   bridge, `authshim` enables forward-auth for apps that lack OIDC, and `agent`
   or `assistant` start the respective tenant runtime.

5. First-run:

       ./scripts/bootstrap-forgejo.sh

   One idempotent script, no web installer: operator admin (password into
   `.env` as break-glass), `agent-dev` user with a repo-scoped token, API
   tokens, and a private `node-config` repo with this directory's history
   pushed. From now on, config changes flow through git. Hand-edits on the
   box are considered migration debt.

6. Identity: initialize Pocket ID at `https://auth.yourdomain/setup` — enrolling
   your passkey IS the setup; there are no passwords. Then invite trusted users
   with `./scripts/invite.sh` (see docs/ONBOARDING.md).

7. Backups (not optional — this box is your identity):

       cp scripts/backup.env.example scripts/backup.env   # fill in restic/B2 creds
       ./scripts/backup.sh                                 # then cron it daily

8. Optional but the point of it all — the resident dev-agent (docs/AGENT.md):

       docker compose --profile agent build
       docker compose run --rm agent

## Layout

    docker-compose.yml      the stack — every image pinned by digest
    docker-compose.staging.yml  the one-file diff that makes the staging twin
    .env.example            secrets template (never commit .env)
    caddy/Caddyfile         routes, annotated by trust ring
    config/litellm.yaml     model list + router settings
    config/homepage/        daily dashboard, tabbed operations view, shared chat bar
    manifest/               placement manifest + app manifests (the contracts)
    registry/               the service registry: manifests -> one discovery endpoint
    agent/                  the dev-agent jail (Dockerfile + operating rules)
    tasks/                  ephemeral-tenant briefs (+ the injection-drill fixture)
    anchor/                 the disposable VPS front door (cloud-init, WG, CoreDNS)
    templates/app-skeleton/ the bare-minimum service every new app starts from
    .agents/skills/         the node's working procedures for resident tenants
    scripts/install.sh      the interview: manifest, reachability, validation
    scripts/backup.sh       restic backup; include list generated from manifests
    scripts/mirror.sh       cache an upstream repo in Forgejo (docs/MIRRORING.md)
    scripts/new-app.sh      seed apps/<name> in Forgejo from the skeleton
    scripts/pin-images.sh   re-pin compose images to current digests
    scripts/staging.sh      the staging twin: same stack, throwaway volumes
    scripts/run-tests.sh    manifest-declared tests against staging
    scripts/promote.sh      staging -> tests -> prod; refuses promotion on red
    scripts/deploy.sh       the deterministic deploy step (promote's last move)
    scripts/run-task.sh     ephemeral agent tenancy: per-run key, one task, teardown
    scripts/task-dispatcher.sh  cron: executes agents' task-request issues (tracked briefs only)
    scripts/drill-injection.sh  prove a prompt-injection cannot escalate

## Configuration layering — what's tracked vs. what's yours

This repository is a public template: everything tracked in git is generic
to any deployment. Everything particular to YOUR node lives in files git
never sees:

| Local-only (gitignored)   | Holds                                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `.env`                    | your domain, email, every secret and minted key |
| `manifest/node.yaml`      | your placement manifest (copied from the example) |
| `caddy/local/*.caddy`     | your extra routes/snippets, auto-imported by the Caddyfile |
| `scripts/backup.env`      | restic repo + storage credentials              |

Tracked config files reference the local layer only through `${VARS}` and
the `import local/*.caddy` glob — if you find yourself typing your domain
or an IP range into a tracked file, stop: it goes in `.env`
(`EXTRA_TRUSTED_RANGES` covers unusual LAN addressing) or `caddy/local/`.

## Non-negotiables

- `.env` and `scripts/backup.env` never enter git.
- The box accepts no inbound connections except through Caddy (and Forgejo SSH if
  you enable it deliberately).
- Agents get LiteLLM *virtual* keys — never provider keys — and no deploy path.
- Internal calls are deny-by-default: apps receive only the scoped credentials
  their manifest declares (see manifest/app.example.toml).
- Search is a capability, not internet access: the Exa key stays behind the
  search egress companion; agents receive only a revocable broker token.
