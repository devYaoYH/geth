# The resident dev-agent

The first tenant of the agent runtime slot: Claude Code running in a jailed
container **inside the node**, which you talk to in a terminal, whose
inference routes through LiteLLM on a budgeted virtual key, and whose only
write path to the node's configuration is a pull request you approve. It
develops the node from within — but it cannot deploy, cannot see secrets,
and cannot spend without a ceiling.

## How it operates, end to end

    you ──(terminal)── agent jail ──(virtual key)── LiteLLM ──> model provider
                          │
                          ├─(scoped token)── Forgejo: clone/branch/push/PR
                          │                     │  operator merges (the approval)
                          │                     ▼
                          └─ NO deploy access   host deploy step pulls main,
                                                `docker compose up -d`

The loop, named by DESIGN.md's policy section: **the agent proposes; git
records; deterministic code enforces; the human approves.** Concretely:

1. You start a session:  `docker compose run --rm agent`  (drops you into
   Claude Code, workspace = a clone of `node-config`).
2. You talk. The agent edits its clone — compose changes, Caddy routes,
   app manifests, migration scripts.
3. It pushes a branch and opens a PR in Forgejo (its Forgejo token allows
   exactly that).
4. You review the diff in Forgejo and merge. That merge IS the
   authorization moment.
5. Deploy is a separate, deterministic step the agent cannot trigger: you
   (for now) run `scripts/deploy.sh` on the host — `git pull` in the
   node-config checkout + `docker compose up -d`. The M2 change pipeline
   replaces "you run it" with staging + tests + auto-promote-on-green.

## Credentials at bring-up (and what it never holds)

Minted per the manifest `needs` pattern — each one individually revocable:

| Credential | Scope | Kill switch |
|---|---|---|
| LiteLLM virtual key | `claude-sonnet` + `claude-haiku`, monthly budget (start: $25), rate-limited | `/key/delete` on LiteLLM |
| Forgejo token | read/write on `node-config` + `apps/*`, read on `mirrors/*`; no admin scope | revoke in Forgejo settings |
| Workspace volume | its own named volume; nothing else mounted | `docker volume rm` |

Never, structurally (not policy — absence):

- **No provider API keys** — it sees `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://litellm:4000`
  and a virtual key; the real key lives in LiteLLM's encrypted store.
- **No `LITELLM_MASTER_KEY`, no `.env`, no vault** — not mounted, not in env.
- **No docker socket** — it cannot start, stop, or inspect containers.
- **No host filesystem** — only its workspace volume.
- **Network: `edge` only** — it reaches services through their published
  ports like any other client; databases are on networks it isn't in.

Compromise analysis: a fully hostile agent (prompt-injected via a mirrored
repo's README, say) can burn its LLM budget and open ugly PRs. It cannot
merge them, deploy anything, read a secret, or touch another service's data.

## Inference routing

Claude Code speaks the Anthropic API natively; LiteLLM exposes an
Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages` endpoint. So the jail just sets:

    ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://litellm:4000
    ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<virtual key>           # minted for this tenant
    ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet                # LiteLLM alias, not a real id

Every call is logged, budgeted, and attributable to the agent's key. Local
inference later (Tier 4) means repointing the LiteLLM alias — the agent
never knows.

## Self-modification, precisely bounded

"The agent develops the node" means: everything in `node-config` is fair
game to *propose* — including its own service definition, its own
CLAUDE.md operating instructions, even this file. The boundary is that
every self-modification travels the same PR path as any other change, and
credential escalation is structurally outside its reach: budgets, token
scopes, and mounts are set on the host side of the merge boundary.
Widening its own jail requires a diff you read and merge with your own
eyes. That property — legible self-modification — is the entire design.

## Worked example: the Keep-clone (Memos)

The first real task, exercising every mechanism above:

1. **Cache upstream:**  `./scripts/mirror.sh https://github.com/usememos/memos`
2. **Agent session:** ask it to add Memos. It writes `manifest/memos.toml`
   (ring 1, volume `memos-data`, backup declared, no LLM needs), a pinned
   compose service, and a `notes.<domain>` Caddy route behind the
   forward-auth snippet; opens the PR.
3. **You merge; deploy runs.** Memos is up, behind your passkey.
4. **Data migration:** export Google Keep via Takeout, drop the archive
   into the agent's workspace. It writes a converter (Takeout JSON →
   Memos API), runs it against `http://memos:5230` with a Memos API token
   you mint for it, shows you the count, deletes the archive.
5. `backup.sh` picks up `memos-data` from the manifest. Restore drill
   covers your notes from then on.

## Interaction surface, staged

- **Now (M0.5):** terminal — `docker compose run --rm agent`. You're on the
  node (or SSH'd in); the session is the operator ring by definition.
- **M3:** the ambient tenant — schedulable tasks (morning digest), a chat
  bridge behind Authentik, still on virtual keys and read-only surfaces.
- **Never:** an LLM in the request-authorization path. Unauthenticated
  internet traffic must not be able to talk its way in.

## Bring-up

The jail is four files in `agent/` (Dockerfile, entrypoint, CLAUDE.md
operating instructions, .gitignore for the workspace) plus a compose
service under `profiles: [agent]`. Steps:

1. Put a provider key in `.env` (LiteLLM needs at least one upstream).
2. Mint the agent's virtual key:
   `curl https://llm.<domain>/key/generate -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_MASTER_KEY" -d '{"key_alias":"agent-dev","models":["claude-sonnet","claude-haiku"],"max_budget":25}'`
   → put the result in `.env` as `AGENT_LLM_KEY`.
3. Create the Forgejo token (user `agent-dev`, repo scope) → `AGENT_FORGEJO_TOKEN`.
4. `docker compose --profile agent build && docker compose run --rm agent`
